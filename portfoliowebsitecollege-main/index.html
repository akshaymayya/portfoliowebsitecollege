                    <p>A Computer Science student with a deep curiosity for technology, industry trends, and how things work. Enjoy researching new advancements, understanding their impact, and exploring creative ways to apply them.</p>
                    
                    <p>While the main focus is tech and problem-solving, I also have a knack for design. I don't see myself as a designer, but I enjoy using design to communicate ideas better.</p>
                    
                    <p>Right now, I'm looking for opportunities to learn from experienced professionals, collaborate on interesting projects, and gain hands-on experience through internships.</p>
