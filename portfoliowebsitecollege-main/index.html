    <div>A Computer Science student with a deep curiosity for technology, industry trends, and how things work.Enjoy researching new advancements, understanding their impact, and exploring creative ways to apply them.
        While the main focus is tech and problem-solving, I also have a knack for design. I don’t see myself as a designer, but I enjoy using design to communicate ideas better. It’s something I like doing, and I’m always open to learning more.
        Right now, I’m looking for opportunities to learn from experienced professionals, collaborate on interesting projects, and gain hands-on experience through internships. If you’re working on something exciting and think I could contribute, lets connect!</div>
